## What are Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system used to track changes in files. It keeps a record of what changes were made. Git allows us to go back to older versions of a project, it allows to work safely without losing work.
GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories. It stores projects on the internet and allows people to share code, collaborate, and manage projects together.

## Why Git and GitHub are Used
Git is used to:
* Tracks code changes 
* Avoid loss of work
* Experiment safely using branches

GitHub is used to:
* Store projects online
* Share code with others
* Work together as a team

## Basic Git Workflow
* A repository is created for a project.
* The repository is cloned from GitHub to the local computer.
* Changes are made to files.
* Changes are saved using a commit with a message.
* The committed changes are pushed to GitHub.
* If others have made changes, we pull the latest updates from GitHub.

## How GitHub Helps in Team Collaboration
GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same project without conflicts. Team members can create branches to work on features separately. Changes can be reviewed using pull requests before being merged into the main branch. This ensures better code quality and reduces errors.
